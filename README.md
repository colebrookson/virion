Thanks for your interest in VIRION! 

This is a dynamically-updated copy of the dataset. It's automatically compiled with new records from GLOBI and GenBank once every two weeks. It was last compiled on the date shown in the above badge.

A quick note about the taxonomy: while GLOBI and GenBank undergo the full taxonomic reconciliation when these new records are compiled, the two manually-curated sources (CLOVER and PREDICT) are only updated when the dataset is hand-recompiled. As a result, some records in the CLOVER and PREDICT components may be out-of-date. If your analysis requires the data to be internally consistent, you may want to use the last manually-compiled version.
